# Smart Study Assistant - Assignment 3.2

## 1. Prototype
**Website URL:** [http://localhost:8888/assignment3.2/](http://localhost:8888/assignment3.2/)  
*(Note: Port may vary depending on your MAMP settings, e.g., localhost:80 or localhost:8888)*

**Data Streams (JSON Format):**
You can view the raw JSON data streams generated by the application here:
- **Transcripts API:** [http://localhost:8888/assignment3.2/api/get_transcripts.php](http://localhost:8888/assignment3.2/api/get_transcripts.php)
- **Dictionary API:** [http://localhost:8888/assignment3.2/api/dictionary_lookup.php?word=accessibility](http://localhost:8888/assignment3.2/api/dictionary_lookup.php?word=accessibility)

## 3. Discussion (Experience Reflection)
**Goal:** The objective was to build a "Smart Study Assistant" that integrates accessibility features like speech-to-text and text-to-speech into a cohesive web application. I aimed to create a modern, "glassmorphism" interface that feels premium and distraction-free.

**Challenges:** The main challenge was integrating multiple asynchronous APIs. For instance, connecting the real-time Web Speech API for transcription with a backend PHP database required careful handling of JSON data streams. Additionally, implementing the "Instant Search" for the dictionary involved debouncing user input to prevent flooding the external API.

**Fascinating:** I found it fascinating how powerful modern browser APIs are. We didn't need complex third-party libraries for speech recognition or synthesis—it's all built into the browser. Connecting this frontend capability with a robust MySQL backend created a seamless experience where data flows instantly between the user's voice and the database.
